node-aql
========

An interface into AQL's APIs

A complete work in progress at the moment, I wouldn't look at using this one yet but hopefully within a week or so it will be in a better place.

Unfortunately, I've had to publish this module to npm in order to fully develop it due to the delivery reports/inbound sms needing a publicly available host (in which case I need npm for easy development on dotcloud)
